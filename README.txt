Description:
This is a Java based chat application. It has been tested on WindowsXP with JRE6 installed. 
This application has been developed for chatting over Local Area Networks(LAN) on Windows PCs.

For this application to work (on Windows), you'll have to: 
1. Connect your computer to a LAN.
2. Setup a 'home or small office network' from the left column in 'My Network Places' which is located in Start menu. Make yourself visible to others. 
3. You will see a list of computers(with their LAN names) on the LAN. Add the computers you want to communicate with, to your 'Workgroup Computers'.
4. Run G-Caprice.
5. To chat with a computer (in your workgroup), add its LAN name in the space provided and give it an appropriate nickname.
6. The computer will be added to the LAN list on the right.
